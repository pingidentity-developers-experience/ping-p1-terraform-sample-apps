# Getting Started

Install Terraform on your machine, following the instructions [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

## Configure PingOne for Terraform access

If not done so already, first configure your PingOne organization for Terraform access by following the instructions at the [PingOne Terraform provider Getting Started Guide](https://pingidentity.github.io/terraform-docs/getting-started/pingone/#configure-pingone-for-terraform-access).

## Cloning the Project
### Variables
After cloning the project, in an IDE (code editor) navigate to `/terraform` and create a file named `terraform.tfvars` with the following name/value pairs. You replace the values in double braces.

```hcl
region_code       = "{{ NA | CA | AP | AU | EU }}"
admin_env_id      = "{{adminEnvId}}"
admin_user_id     = "{{adminUserId}}"
license_id        = "{{licenseId}}"
worker_id         = "{{workerId}}"
worker_secret     = "{{workerSecret}}"
k8s_deploy_name   = "{{k8sDeployName}}"
k8s_deploy_domain = "{{k8sDeployDomain}}"
k8s_namespace     = "{{k8sNamespace}}"
proxy_image_name  = "docker.io/michaelspingidentity/ping-integration-proxy:0.1.0"
app_image_name    = "docker.io/michaelspingidentity/ping-bxretail-terraform-sample:latest"
deploy_app_to_k8s = [true | false]
app_port          = 5000
```


| Variable | Description | 
| -------- | ----------- |
| region_code | Region code for PingOne Environment (`NA`, `CA`, `AP`, `AU` or `EU`) | 
| admin_env_id | PingOne Environment Id for Administrators Environment - Located under Environment -> Properties |
| admin_user_id | User Id for a user in the Administrators Environment - Located under Identities -> Users -> Select user -> Click API tab -> ID |
| license_id | License Id to be used for PingOne Environment - Located under Environment -> Properties, see [PingOne Terraform provider Getting Started Guide](https://pingidentity.github.io/terraform-docs/getting-started/pingone/#finding-required-ids) for further instructions.|
| worker_id | Client Id for Worker App in the Administrators Environment - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select existing Worker App or create one -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client ID |
| worker_secret | Client Secret for Worker App in the Administrators Environment - Located under Connections -> Applications -> Select Worker App -> Configuration -> Expand General -> Client Secret |
| k8s_deploy_name | Name used for k8s deployment |
| k8s_deploy_domain | K8s Deploy Domain name |
| k8s_namespace | K8s Namespace to deploy app |
| app_image_name | The name and tag of the Docker image pulled from DockerHub. For reference only in the console log.
| deploy_app_to_k8s | Whether to deploy the sample app to your k8s cluster, or deploy the app locally to your laptop running at localhost. ***NOTE:*** if you set this to false, you need to uncomment the resources in docker.tf. This is because even if you choose to deploy with k8s, `terraform plan` will still check if the Docker runtime is available.
| app_port | Defaults to 5000. Port the localhost version of the app runs at.

### Deployment

Decide whether you want the sample app deployed to your own k8s cluster, or just have it run locally on your laptop/desktop. Then change the `deploy_app_to_k8s` variable in your `terraform.tfvars` file accordingly. See variables section above for details.

In the command line, navigate to the `/terraform` directory and run:

```zsh
terraform init
terraform plan
```

If the plan fails - check your `terraform.tfvars` values.

If the plan succeeds:

```hcl
terraform apply â€”auto-approve
````

If this is successful, you will see a new environment added to your PingOne organization under the name `Ping Identity Example`. 

**NOTE:** The k8s deployment creates new ingresses and a subdomain for the app of `k8s_deploy_name.k8s_deploy_domain`. So the app may not be immediately available when terraforming is complete. Go get yourself some coff-ay and try again.

Similarly, if you choose to deploy the app locally, the app may not load immediately depending on the amount of resources you allocated to the Docker runtime or the usual suspects; busy CPU, other resource intensive processes running, etc. 

#### Deploying App Locally Using Existing PingOne Environment

If you'd like to point this sample app to an existing PingOne environment and skip terraforming a new environment, you can do so by following the instructions below.

Update the `deploy_app_to_k8s` variable in your `terraform.tfvars` file to "false".

Navigate to the `.env.development` file in the `/bxretail-sample-app` directory, you'll need to uncomment the `REACT_APP_ENVID` and `REACT_APP_CLIENT` variables and set to your PingOne Environment Id and Application Client Id. 

Then, navigate to the `env.sh` file in the `/bxretail-sample-app` directory, and comment out the last line in this file that self-destructs the file. 

Once you've saved these changes, in your terminal, cd into the `/bxretail-sample-app` directory and run `npm start`. Before attempting to start the app, you will need to run `npm install` in this directory if you haven't already. 

### Optional - Custom Docker Images
Ping Identity Technical Enablement hosts and maintains the sample Docker image. However, it is possible to build and host your own Docker images by following the instructions below.

To start, you will need your own Docker image repository to push to and update your `terraform.tfvars` file accordingly. Depending on your image repository, whether that's local, ECR, GCR, etc, you may need to update the `k8s.tf` file too. 

Note: In this current version, we are not using the fastify proxy server image. So recreating that is unnecessary.

**From the command line**, change directories to the `/bxretail-sample-app` directory.

```zsh
cd <your project path>/BXTerraform/BXTerraform-Sample-Apps/BXRetail-Terraform-pkg/bxretail-sample-app
```

Then run: 
```zsh
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t <host>/<repo_path>/ping-bxretail-terraform-sample:<version_tag> .
```

Note for Macbook M1 and later:
The new M1/M2 chip architecture is different, so Docker has to be told which architecture to target when building images. If this is you, then your `build` command would be,
```
docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 -f Dockerfile.dev -t <host>/<repo_path>/ping-bxretail-terraform-sample:<version_tag> .
```

`docker buildx` details found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx/).
