# BXRetail Sample App by PingIdentity Demo Engineering

## Introduction
BXRetail is a demo application developed by Ping Identity's Demo Engineering team to showcase various use cases implemented in a real-world looking, online retail application. The application was branded and designed to look identical to an online retail app. Because many features of online retail do not relate to Ping's line of business, many links or features are not functional. They are still included for aesthetic reality. 

It is a unique demo due to our PingOne-led initiative, with no non-SaaS software added to the environment.

BXRetail is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React; JSX, Javascript, react-router, react-strap, SASS, JSON.

### Source Docs
We include HTML formatted documentation using the JSDoc utility. Just open the `index.html` file in the `/jsdocs/` folder.

Also, all Ping integration methods are annotated with links to the related API docs. All of this is picked up by JSDoc, too.
